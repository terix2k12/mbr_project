The FBR approach

footprint set, is a subset of the case base. "provides the same coverage as the case base as a whole"

A problem t has three relations
RetrievalSpace - cases retrieved for the problem t
AdaptionSpace - cases can be adapted to solve t
Solves - Retrieval INTERSECT AdaptionSpace

for a case c there is
ReachabilitySet - alle cases die in retreival und l√∂sung gleich sind mit c
Coverageset -
